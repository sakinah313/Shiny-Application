### Developing Data Products

- Course Project

- Application for the best car to buy 

- by Sakinah


## Introduction
This presentation is part of the Course Project for the Coursera Developing Data Products class. The peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, we should use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application. This presentation adresses the second part of the course project.

The app developed for the first part of the assignment is avalilable at:

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the GitHub:
